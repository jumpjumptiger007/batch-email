## System Components

### 1. Batch Email Sender (`batch-email-smtp.py`)

Sends marketing emails in batches via Google's SMTP server, respecting subscription preferences.

```python
from batch_email_smtp import BatchEmailSender

# Initialize the sender
sender = BatchEmailSender(
    smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",
    port=587,
    email="your.email@yourdomain.com",
    password="your-app-password"  # App password, not regular password
)

# Send batch emails
results = sender.send_batch_from_csv(
    # You can use either the original list or the pre-filtered list:
    csv_path="examples/recipients.csv",  # Original list with 'subscribed' column
    # csv_path="examples/filtered_output.csv",  # Pre-filtered list
    html_template=html_template,
    text_template=text_template,
    subject_template="Special Offer Inside! üéÅ {campaign_id}",
    use_bcc=True,
    batch_size=50,
    check_unsubscribed=True  # Set to False if using filtered_output.csv
)

print(f"Results: {results['success']} sent, {results['failed']} failed, {results['skipped']} unsubscribed")
```

### 2. Unsubscribe Handler (`unsubscribe-handler.py`)

Flask web service that handles unsubscribe requests and manages subscriber preferences.

```
# Run the unsubscribe service
python unsubscribe-handler.py
```

### 3. Subscriber Database Manager (`sync-subscribers.py`)

Utilities for managing your subscriber database and keeping email lists in sync.

```
# Import subscribers from the example CSV
python sync-subscribers.py --import examples/recipients.csv

# Create a filtered list excluding unsubscribed recipients
python sync-subscribers.py --filter examples/recipients.csv filtered_output.csv

# Update the original CSV file with current subscription status
python sync-subscribers.py --update examples/recipients.csv

# One-step sync: Import new subscribers and update the CSV file
python sync-subscribers.py --sync-all
```

### 4. Database Setup (`create-database.py`)

Sets up the SQLite database for tracking subscriptions and unsubscribe reasons.

```
# Create or reset the database
python create-database.py
```

## Usage Guide

### Setting Up a Google App Password

Since you've enabled 2-step verification, you'll need an app password:

1. Go to your Google Account at https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Click on "Security" in the left panel
3. Under "Signing in to Google," click on "App passwords"
4. Select "Mail" and your device type
5. Generate and copy the 16-character password

### Preparing Your Email List

Create a CSV with at minimum these columns:
- `email`: Recipient email address
- `first_name`: Recipient's first name (for personalization)
- `last_name`: Recipient's last name (for personalization)

Additional columns can be used for template variables. You can use the sample file provided in the `examples/recipients.csv` as a starting point:

```csv
email,first_name,last_name,campaign_id,marketing_message
john.doe@example.com,John,Doe,SPRING2025,"Check out our spring collection with 20% off!"
```

The repository includes a complete example CSV in the `examples` folder that you can use as a template for your own recipient lists.

### Creating Email Templates

HTML Template Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
        .header { background-color: #4CAF50; padding: 20px; color: white; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="header">
        <h1>Special Offer!</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Hello {first_name}!</p>
    <p>{marketing_message}</p>
    <p>To unsubscribe, <a href="https://example.com/unsubscribe?email={email}">click here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Complete Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Use the included example database or create your own: `python create-database.py`
   - If creating your own, import your marketing list: `python sync-subscribers.py --import examples/recipients.csv`
   - Set up the unsubscribe web service: `python unsubscribe-handler.py`

2. **Before Each Campaign** (Important):
   - Always run the sync command to update subscription status: `python sync-subscribers.py --sync-all`
   - This step is critical as the CSV file won't automatically update when users unsubscribe
   - The sync command ensures you don't send emails to people who have unsubscribed since your last campaign
   - Alternatively, use the pre-filtered example: `examples/filtered_output.csv`

3. **Sending the Campaign**:
   - Run the batch email sender with your templates and updated recipient list
   - You can use the provided filtered example: `examples/filtered_output.csv`
   - The sender will respect the 'subscribed' column in your CSV file
   - Monitor the logs for sending status

4. **After Sending**:
   - Keep the unsubscribe service running to collect unsubscribe requests
   - Review unsubscribe reasons to improve future campaigns
   - Next time you send a campaign, start again from step 2

## Unsubscribe Page Integration

1. Make sure the unsubscribe web service is running
2. In your email templates, include a personalized unsubscribe link:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/unsubscribe?email={email}
   ```
3. The system will automatically replace `{email}` with each recipient's email

## Best Practices

- Always include a clear unsubscribe link in every email
- Respect unsubscription requests promptly
- Keep your subscriber database up to date
- Use the `check_unsubscribed` parameter to prevent emails to unsubscribed users
- Add delays between batches to avoid hitting sending limits
- Test with small batches before sending to your entire list
