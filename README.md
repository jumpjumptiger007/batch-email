## System Components

### 1. Batch Email Sender (`batch-email-smtp.py`)

Sends marketing emails in batches via Google's SMTP server, respecting subscription preferences.

```python
from batch_email_smtp import BatchEmailSender

# Initialize the sender
sender = BatchEmailSender(
    smtp_server="smtp.gmail.com",
    port=587,
    email="your.email@yourdomain.com",
    password="your-app-password"  # App password, not regular password
)

# Send batch emails
results = sender.send_batch_from_csv(
    csv_path="recipients.csv",
    html_template=html_template,
    text_template=text_template,
    subject_template="Special Offer Inside! üéÅ {campaign_id}",
    use_bcc=True,
    batch_size=50,
    check_unsubscribed=True
)

print(f"Results: {results['success']} sent, {results['failed']} failed, {results['skipped']} unsubscribed")
```

### 2. Unsubscribe Handler (`unsubscribe-handler.py`)

Flask web service that handles unsubscribe requests and manages subscriber preferences.

```
# Run the unsubscribe service
python unsubscribe-handler.py
```

### 3. Subscriber Database Manager (`sync-subscribers.py`)

Utilities for managing your subscriber database and keeping email lists in sync.

```
# Import subscribers from a CSV
python sync-subscribers.py --import your_list.csv

# Create a filtered list excluding unsubscribed recipients
python sync-subscribers.py --filter input.csv filtered_output.csv
```

### 4. Database Setup (`create-database.py`)

Sets up the SQLite database for tracking subscriptions and unsubscribe reasons.

```
# Create or reset the database
python create-database.py
```

## Usage Guide

### Setting Up a Google App Password

Since you've enabled 2-step verification, you'll need an app password:

1. Go to your Google Account at https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Click on "Security" in the left panel
3. Under "Signing in to Google," click on "App passwords"
4. Select "Mail" and your device type
5. Generate and copy the 16-character password

### Preparing Your Email List

Create a CSV with at minimum these columns:
- `email`: Recipient email address
- `first_name`: Recipient's first name (for personalization)
- `last_name`: Recipient's last name (for personalization)

Additional columns can be used for template variables:
```csv
email,first_name,last_name,campaign_id,marketing_message
john.doe@example.com,John,Doe,SPRING2025,"Check out our spring collection with 20% off!"
```

### Creating Email Templates

HTML Template Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
        .header { background-color: #4CAF50; padding: 20px; color: white; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="header">
        <h1>Special Offer!</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Hello {first_name}!</p>
    <p>{marketing_message}</p>
    <p>To unsubscribe, <a href="https://example.com/unsubscribe?email={email}">click here</a>.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### Complete Workflow

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Create the database
   - Import your existing marketing list
   - Set up the unsubscribe web service

2. **Before Each Campaign**:
   - Update your recipient CSV
   - Create a filtered version excluding unsubscribed users
   - Prepare your email templates

3. **Sending the Campaign**:
   - Run the batch email sender with your templates and filtered list
   - Monitor the logs for sending status

4. **After Sending**:
   - Keep the unsubscribe service running to collect unsubscribe requests
   - Review unsubscribe reasons to improve future campaigns

## Unsubscribe Page Integration

1. Make sure the unsubscribe web service is running
2. In your email templates, include a personalized unsubscribe link:
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/unsubscribe?email={email}
   ```
3. The system will automatically replace `{email}` with each recipient's email

## Best Practices

- Always include a clear unsubscribe link in every email
- Respect unsubscription requests promptly
- Keep your subscriber database up to date
- Use the `check_unsubscribed` parameter to prevent emails to unsubscribed users
- Add delays between batches to avoid hitting sending limits
- Test with small batches before sending to your entire list
